Design of algorithms

<span id="anchor"></span>Optimization problem

A problem which can have many possible solutions. We seek to find the
best among all those solutions.

Example :

- Rod cutting problem – There are many ways to cut a rod(many possible
  solutions). We seek to find the way which maximizes revenue
- Knapsack problem – There are many ways to fill a knapsack. We seek to
  find the way to fill it so that goods of maximum value can be found.

What does it mean to say that an a problem exhibits
<span id="anchor-1"></span>optimal substructure?

That it can be broken up into subproblems such that the solution of the
problem incorporates solutions of these related subproblems which we may
solve independently.
