Medians and Order Statistics(linear time selection)

Minimum and maximum selection

- n – 1 comparisons. Viewing this as a tournament.
- Simultaneous maximum and minimum using at
  most$$3{\lfloor{n/3}\rfloor}$$ comparisons.
- Finding second smallest number
  using$${({n–1})} + {\lceil{\mathit{\lg}n–1}\rceil}$$comparisons.

Randomized select

- Algorithm
- Linear average case performance
- [Implementation](https://github.com/AbhijithMadhav/sorting/blob/master/Sorting/src/sorting/quicksort/RSelect.java)

Deterministic select

- Algorithm
- Linear worst case performance
- Implementation
