---+++ Iterative solution using stacks
   * Push operators into the stack
   * Push the first operand into the stack
   * When the second operand is encountered pop the first operand and the operator, evaluate the expression, push the result back into the stack
   * The result of the prefix expression is found in the stack at the end of scanning a valid prefix expression

* To check that the first operand is in the stack*
   * The top of the stack is examined.
      * operator - first operand is not present
      * operator - first operand is present
*Source: From the net*

---+++Recursive solution
   * If an operand is found return the operand to the callee.
   * if an operator is found, go deeper into the recursion chain to find the two respective operands. Evaluate and return the result to the callee
*Source: Algorithms using C++, Sedgewick*
