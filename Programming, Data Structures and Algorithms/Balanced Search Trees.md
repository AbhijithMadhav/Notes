Balanced search trees

Rotation

- An operation on a binary tree that changes the structure without
  interfering with the order of the elements. A tree rotation moves one
  node up in the tree and one node down. It is used to change the shape
  of the tree, and in particular to decrease its height by moving
  smaller subtrees down and larger subtrees up, resulting in improved
  performance of many tree operations.
- Left rotation
- Right rotation
- Double rotation
